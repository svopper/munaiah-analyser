    # This runs the test suite. Since we need some system dependencies
    # (e.g. pygobject) that cannot easily be installed inside a
    # virtualenv using pip (that requires installing a dozen -dev
    # packages and building parts of pygobject from source, which makes
    # things way too complicated), this just runs with the Ubuntu system
    # python (e.g. not using the standard setup-python action, which
    # sets up a virtualenv).
