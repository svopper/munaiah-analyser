          Hey! This pull request targets the `master` branch. You should probably target `dev` instead. Make sure to read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/colobot/colobot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-pull-requests) and [edit the target branch if necessary](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).
    - name: Wrong pull request target
      if: github.base_ref == 'master'
      run: echo "This pull request targets the master branch. Please edit the pull request to target dev." && exit 1
    - name: Correct pull request target
      if: github.base_ref != 'master'
      run: echo "This pull request targets the correct branch." && exit 0
