More specifically we wanted to use the generated POJOs as resources of the Synapse JSON REST web services API. Since we are using the POJOs as REST resources we also wanted an easy way to marsh instances to/from JSON.  Lastly, we also wanted to use the generated POJOs in our Google Web Toolkit (GWT) client-side code and server side code.  Thus the schema-to-pojo project was born.
