# Performing a release is done by executing a perform-release event through a repository webhook.
# This needs to be executed by issuing an authenticated REST Post operation, to prevent accidental or unauthorized releases.
# See documentation for details on how to execute this.
# This will kick off this workflow, which will attempt to update the pom by removing SNAPSHOT, commit these changes,
# build, test, and deploy this to the non-SNAPSHOT Maven repository, update the pom to next SNAPSHOT and commit,
# merge this branch down to master, and then deletes this branch
